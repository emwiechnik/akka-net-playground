# Akka.NET playground 
It is an app implemented by following a very good course [Building Concurrent Applications with the Actor Model in Akka.NET](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/akka-dotnet-actor-model-building-concurrent-applications/table-of-contents). I can actually highly recommend it:)

Along the way, I needed to update minor things, because in the later version of Akka.NET some APIs got deprecated.
As this is a .NET Core console application, loading of the HOCON configuration is also done differently than instructed.

Maybe somebody finds the code helpful.
